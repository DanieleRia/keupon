            <span class="faq_redtxt">How does it work?</span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Keupons.com is based on the principle of “group-size based discount”. At Keupons.com we believe that EVERYONE should enjoy the best possible discount! And in keeping with our aim of “The More The Merrier”, our deals are made in such a way that the discount INCREASES as MORE people sign-up for a deal! This way, you can tailor your discount based on the number of people who sign-up.
			<br/>
            <br/>
            <i>For example, you may be willing to give a 40% discount if less than 50 customers buy your deal, 50% off if 51-100 customers buy your deal, and increase your discount progressively as the number of customers increase.</i>
            <br/>
            <br/>
			As you can see based on the example above, you have the flexibility to tailor the size of your discount, while still ensuring that there is an incentive for customers to buy your offer. Decide based on your expectations, and match and make the discount you are willing to offer for different numbers of people. Remember though, that if you give too low a discount or require too many people to sign-up for the maximum discount, the results you get may not match up to your expectations. But do not worry, our experienced business development team will work with you to design the optimal deal and help you can gain maximum brand recall at no extra cost!

            <span class="faq_redtxt">How is Keupons.com different from traditional<br/>marketing? How can it maximize my ROI?</span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Most businesses do not have the budget for traditionally mass advertising which requires large upfront spending without being able to predict the number of actual end users.
            <br/>
            <br/>
			What Keupons.com offers is performance-based spending. Your marketing spend translates directly into higher sales, allowing you to maximize your ROI. This is an ideal solution where spending is done based on actual customer conversions, also known as 'Pay-as-You-Go'.
